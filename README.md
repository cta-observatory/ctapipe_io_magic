## *ctapipe* MAGIC event source

EventSource plugin for *ctapipe*, needed to read the calibrated data of the MAGIC telescope system. It requires the [*ctapipe*](https://github.com/cta-observatory/ctapipe) (v0.12.0) and [*uproot*](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot4) (>=4.1) packages to run.

#### Installation

Provided that *ctapipe* is already installed, the installation can be done via *pip* (the module is available in PyPI):

```bash
pip install ctapipe_io_magic
```

Alternatively, you can always clone the repository and install like in the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cta-observatory/ctapipe_io_magic.git
pip install ./ctapipe_io_magic/
```

This installation via *pip* (provided, *pip* is installed) has the advantage to be nicely controlled for belonging to a given conda environment (and to be uninstalled). Alternatively, do

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cta-observatory/ctapipe_io_magic.git
cd ctapipe_io_magic
python setup.py install --user
```

In all cases, using *pip* will check if the version of *ctapipe* and *uproot* is compatible with the requested version of *ctapipe_io_magic*.

#### Usage

```python
import ctapipe
from ctapipe_io_magic import MAGICEventSource

with MAGICEventSource(input_url=file_name) as event_source:
    for event in event_source:
        ...some processing...
```

With more recent versions of *ctapipe*, only one file at a time can be read. However, by default if a subrun of calibrated data is given as input, `MAGICEventSource` will read the events from all the subruns from the run to which the data file belongs. To suppress this behavior, set `process_run=False` No matching of the events is performed at this level (if stereo data).

Starting from v0.4.7, `MAGICEventSource` will automatically recognize the type of data contained in the calibrated ROOT files (stereo or mono; std trigger or SumT). For MC data, in the case stereo MC data are to be used for mono analysis, one can set to True the `use_mc_mono_events` option of the `MAGICEventSource` to use also mono triggered events.

Pedestal events (trigger pattern = 8) can be generated as well.

The reader is able to handle real data or Monte Carlo files, which are automatically recognized. Note that the names of input files have to follow the convention:
-   `*_M[1-2]_RUNNUMBER.SUBRUNNR_Y_*.root` for real data
-   `*_M[1-2]_za??to??_?_RUNNUMBER_Y_*.root` for simulated data.

However, the information which can be extracted from the file names is read directly from within the ROOT files.

##### More usage

Select a single run:

```python
run = event_source._set_active_run(event_source.run_numbers[0])
# run is an object of type MarsCalibratedRun
# assuming we are reading data from a file from M1
for n in range(run['data'].n_mono_events_m1):
    run['data'].get_mono_event_data(n, 'M1')

for n in range(run['data'].n_pedestal_events_m1):
    run['data'].get_pedestal_event_data(n, 'M1')
```

Select events triggering in stereo and pedestal events from a single telescope (recognized automatically) over event generator:

```python
# select (stereo) cosmic events from all subruns of a given run (the one to which file_name belongs)
event_generator = MAGICEventSource(input_url=file_name)
for cosmic_event in event_generator:
    ...some processing...

# select (stereo) cosmic events from a single subrun
event_generator = MAGICEventSource(input_url=file_name, process_run=False)
for cosmic_event in event_generator:
    ...some processing...

# select pedestal events
pedestal_event_generator = MAGICEventSource(input_url=file_name, use_pedestals=True)
for pedestal_event in pedestal_event_generator:
    ...some processing...
```

#### Features

##### Drive reports interpolation

By default, when all subruns from a given run are processed, the drive reports are collected from all subruns so that the telescope pointing position for each event can be computed. Also in the case that only one subrun is processed (`process_run=False`), all drive reports from the subruns belonging to the same run will be used. This ensures that interpolation is performed correctly.

##### Monitoring data

Monitoring data are saved in `run['data'].monitoring_data` and can also accessed event-wise via the `event.mon` container. Available information is:
-   dead pixels: `event.mon.tel[tel_id].pixel_status.hardware_failing_pixels[0]`
-   hot pixels:  `event.mon.tel[tel_id].pixel_status.pedestal_failing_pixels[i_ped_type]`, where `i_ped_type` is an index indicating which pedestal type to use (0 is `PedestalFundamental`, 1 is `PedestalFromExtractor` and 2 is `PedestalFromExtractorRndm`)

Dead and hot pixels are used in `magic-cta-pipe` for the MAGIC cleaning.

##### Simulation Configuration Data
Some general information about the simulated data, useful for IRF calculation, are read from the root files and stored in data.simulation container.
